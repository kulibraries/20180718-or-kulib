  This hands-on workshop draws on the <a href="{{site.lc_site}}">Library Carpentry</a> OpenRefine lesson to introduce data manipulation and cleaning using this powerful, open-source tool. The Carpentries aim to help researchers get work done in less time and with less pain by teaching basic research computing skills. Increasingly, library professionals work in contexts that can benefit from these same skills. For more information on the Library Carpentry curriculum, please see "<a href="http://doi.org/10.18352/lq.10176">Library Carpentry: software skills training for library professionals</a>". Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own work problems.
